# GTNH Translations

中文 / 日本語 / 한국어 / Português brasileiro / Français

This is a repository managing all the translations for GTNH.

<!-- Contents below don't need to be translated! -->

## For translators

### Why?

We dicided to manage all the translations under this repository for these reasons:

- Each language has one central team so that everyone can collaborate.
- We can share workflows to manage all the translations, information on changes made to mods, etc.
- Managing translations on external site is by far convenient than on GitHub.

### I want to make contribution to existing language

Each project has its own ParaTranz project. You can join there with your GitHub account.

### I want to make contribution to language that is not listed

If you have 3 or more translators for the language, please contact boubou_19.
